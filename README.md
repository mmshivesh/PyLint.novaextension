# PyLint

This extension adds support for PyLint in Nova.

## Requirements

Needs PyLint to be installed:

```bash
pip install pylint
```

(or) 

```bash
pip3 install pylint
```

## Configuration

Default PyLint path is `/usr/local/bin/pylint`. Configure how Nova highlights issues raised by PyLint.

### Ignoring PyLint Issues:

1. You can choose to ignore issues generated by PyLint using appropriate command line flags using `--disable=<FLAGS>` or specific comment blocks (check the PyLint [documentation](http://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/user_guide/message-control.html) for further information). 

2. You can choose to make Nova ignore them (the issues will however still be generated by PyLint) by choosing `Ignore` from the dropdown for each of the PyLint Issue categories in the extension preferences.
